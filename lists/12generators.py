#Like list comprehensions, but create iterable generator objects that produce values on demand.
#Known as lazy evaluation.
#For large numbers of items, creating lists can take substantial memory and time.
#Generator expressions can reduce memory consumption and improve performance if the whole list is not needed at once.
